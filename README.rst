A Jupyter kernel for MrBayes

This requires `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`_, and MrBayes installed.

Install as ``pip install mrbayes_kernel``.

Then, you can select the "MrBayes" Kernel in the Jupyter Notebook.

This is based on `MetaKernel <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/metakernel>`_,
which means it features a standard set of magics.

A sample notebook is available online_.

You can specify the path to your ```mb``` executable by creating an `MRBAYES_EXECUTABLE` environmental variable.
